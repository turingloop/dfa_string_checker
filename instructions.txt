I attached a screenshot to help you with how to give outputs.

If you don't want to the built the software again, just use the jar file i attached. 
Go to the command line and enter "java -jar SimDFA.jar" in the appropriate folder.
Just in case if you want to know how my code works, i am attaching my source files as well!

1. The first number you enter will generate the number of states. For example if you enter 6, it will create 6 states from q0 to q5.

2. Next select starting and final state. If you created 6 states, then you can select anywhere from 0 - 5 numbers for starting or final states.

3. Next enter a,b routes for each states.

4. Next enter the string you want to test.

5. Now the program will tell you if it is accepted or not!

Hope these instructions helped you!
